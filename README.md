# pong-webrtc

Online pong game with the use of WebGL and WebRTC. You can play with almost everyone in the world (Some NAT routers will not allow it), just choose a room and allow to get recorded by the webcam. The other user should connect to the same room and you will see each other.

This game is running at https://pong.merpi.tk/

If you want to run the game in your own server, execute `npm install` and run with `node server.js`. Change the certificates if you want it more secure.
